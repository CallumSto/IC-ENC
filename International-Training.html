		<h1>International ENC Validation training course</h1>

		<h3 align="Right">...Training provided to 42 individuals from 30 different ENC producers</h3>
		 
		<p>IC-ENC launched its International ENC Validation training course as part of its capacity building initiative at the start of 2014. A ‘pilot’ course ran 
		successfully in March 2014 for three delegates, and we received some great constructive feedback which was put into action straight away. Following 
		the success of the pilot course, the decision was made to deliver three training courses in 2015. These three courses were held in:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Taunton, UK - February</li>
			<li>Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia - May/June</li>
			<li>Panama, Central America - September</li>
		</ul>
		
		<Br>
		
		<p>Following the successful delivery of these courses, IC-ENC has now provided training to 42 individuals from 30 different ENC producers. The IC-ENC 
		Steering Committee has just approved the delivery of three more training courses in 2016:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Taunton, UK - 4th - 14th July</li>
			<li>Panama Canal Authority, Panama - 5th - 16th September</li>
			<li>National Hydrographic Centre, Malaysia - TBC</li>
		</ul>	
		
		<h2>Course Trainer's Message</h2>
		
		<img src="Images\TrainingSesh01.jpg" width ="350px" align="right">
		
		<p>"The International ENC Validation training course provides the knowledge, skills and 
		understanding required to enable ENC Production teams to perform validation in their 
		home offices to a high standard. The course allows familiarisation with the full IC-ENC 
		ENC Validation process from start to finish, including conformance to the relevant IHO 
		Standards and the various software tools used. The course also includes familiarisation 
		with the eGlobe G2 ECDIS, and upon completion of the course, each delegate will be 
		given the eGlobe G2 ECDIS software to take back to their offices in order to encourage 
		ENC Production teams to include the use of an ECDIS as part of their production and 
		validation processes. </p>

		<p>This course has proven to be an excellent method for exchanging knowledge, ideas and 
		experience between different producing nations. As a result, we see great working 
		relationships established during the two week period.</p>

		<p>In order to get the most from the course, I would highly encourage that you send at least 
		two delegates from your offices to attend course in order that the knowledge can be 
		shared amongst the whole office. </p>

		<p>In addition to delivering training courses around the world for our members, we offer a 
		four week training secondment for the heads of ENC production teams. Secondments 
		are held at IC-ENC UK (HQ), and focus on providing the individuals a team leader 
		perspective in order to maximise the potential of their ENC production team.</p>

		<p>I thoroughly enjoyed delivering the training courses this year, and I am already excited 
		for what 2016 has in store for IC-ENC and its members!"</p>

		<p><i>“The most useful parts of the course were being able to get to know the whole process of validation from start to finish, and meeting IC-ENC staff 
		members and representatives of other Hydrographic Office to exchange information and experiences amongst ourselves” – Slovenian Hydrographic 
		Office</i></p>

					"I am so happy to hear about the success of the three 
					International ENC Validation training courses which have had 
					taken place in 2015. Not only has IC-ENC conducted the course 
					in the UK, but also in Australia and Panama, which are all great 
					achievements.

					The training programme was set up by a principal strategic 
					decision of the IC-ENC Steering Committee not only to invest in 
					technology, but to invest in people. This notion was proposed 
					first by the former Australian Hydrographer, Rod Nairn, and I am 
					proud to say that we are now turning it into reality. There are not 
					many governmental technical standards which are applied 
					globally – but it is great that ENC production is one of the few. 
					IC-ENC has now released more than  5,600 ENCs out of 13,000 
					worlds coverage. This is a good portion and expected to grow.
					</p>
					
					<p style="color: #000000;font-size: 13px; font-family: Segoe UI light,Segoe UI,Segoe,Tahoma,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; line-height: 20.8px; font-weight: normal;">
					The skills you are about to obtain from this training course 
					cannot be overestimated in many aspects. It is surely for the 
					benefit for your national hydrography but – at the same time - for 
					the benefit of the mariners of all nations navigating your waters 
					as well. In addition, joint education results in team building, and 
					the harmonization of ENC data leads to cross border co-
					operation. Co-operation results in mutual understanding between 
					nations and mentalities. This is what our fragile planet needs, 
					and this is an important side effect of your collaboration. I am 
					convinced you share this spirit within the group and take this 
					inspiration back to your home office wherever it is.
					</p>

					Let me finish by wishing you all the best."
